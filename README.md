# htmldiff.js

Diff and markup HTML with `<ins>` and `<del>` tags.

## Origin

Quote from the original source of this fork:

_`htmldiff.js` is a JavaScript port of [https://github.com/myobie/htmldiff](https://github.com/myobie/htmldiff) by
[Keanu Lee](http://keanulee.com) at [Inkling](https://www.inkling.com/)._

**htmldiff.js** is based on [this fork](https://github.com/inkling/htmldiff.js) and adds a few things:

- Diffing of video, math, widget, iframe, img and svg tags.
- Ability to set atomic tags via the API.
- A command line interface.
- TypeScript support.
- Better documentation.

See also _Credits_ below.

## Description

htmldiff takes two HTML snippets or files and marks the differences between them with
`<ins>` and `<del>` tags. The diffing understands HTML so it doesn't do a pure text diff,
instead it will insert the appropriate tags for changed/added/deleted text nodes, single
tags or tag hierarchies.

The module can be used as module in Node.js, with RequireJS, or even just as a script tag.

## API

The module exports a single default function:

JavaScript:

```javascript
diff(before, after, className, dataPrefix, atomicTags);
```

TypeScript:

```javascript
function diff(before: string, after: string, className?: string | null, dataPrefix?: string | null, atomicTags?: string | null): string;
```

### Parameters

- `before` (string) is the original HTML text.
- `after` (string) is the HTML text after the changes have been applied.

The return value is a string with the diff result, marked by `<ins>` and `del` tags. The
function has three optional parameters. If an empty string or `null` is used for any
of these three parameters it will be ignored:

- `className` (string) className will be added as a class attribute on every inserted
  `<ins>` and `<del>` tag.
- `dataPrefix` (string) The data prefix to use for data attributes. The so called _operation
  index data attribute_ will be named `data-${dataPrefix-}operation-index`. If not used,
  the default attribute name `data-operation-index` will be added on every inserted
  `<ins>` and `<del>` tag. The value of this attribute is an auto incremented counter.
- `atomicTags` (string) Comma separated list of tag names. The list has to be in the form
  `tag1,tag2,...` e. g. `head,script,style`. An atomic tag is one whose child nodes should
  not be compared - the entire tag should be treated as one token. This is useful for tags
  where it does not make sense to insert `<ins>` and `<del>` tags. If not used, the default
  list will be used:
  `iframe,object,math,svg,script,video,head,style`.

### Example

JavaScript:

```javascript
diff = require('node-htmldiff');

console.log(diff('<p>This is some text</p>', '<p>That is some more text</p>', 'myClass'));
```

TypeScript:

```javascript
  import diff = require("node-htmldiff");

  console.log(diff("<p>This is some text</p>", "<p>That is some more text</p>", "myClass"));
```

Please note that `diff` is only an arbitrary name; since the module exports only one default
function you can use whatever name you like, e. g., `diffHTML`.

Result:

```html
<p>
	<del data-operation-index="1" class="myClass">This</del><ins data-operation-index="1" class="myClass">That</ins> is
	some<ins data-operation-index="3" class="myClass"> more</ins> text.
</p>
```

## Command line interface

```bash
htmldiff beforeFile afterFile diffedFile [-c className] [-p dataPrefix] [-t atomicTags]
```

Parameters:

- `beforeFile` An HTML input file in its original form.

- `afterFile` An HTML input file, based on `beforeFile` but with changes.

- `diffedFile` Name of the diffed HTML output file. All differences between
  `beforeFile` and `afterFile` will be surrounded with `<ins>` and `<del>`
  tags. If diffedFile is `-` (minus) the result will be written with
  `console.log()` to stdout.

Options:

`-c className`, `-p dataPrefix` and `-t atomicTags` are all optional. For a
description please see API documentation above.

## Development

After cloning the repository run `npm i` or `npm install` to install the necessary
dependencies. A run of `npm run make` creates the JavaScript output file.
`npm run lint` checks the TypeScript sources with TSLint. `npm test` runs all the
tests from the `test` directory. `npm run testsample` diffs the HTML sample files
from the directory `sample` and logs the result to the console.

The command line interface of htmldiff is developed in TypeScript so you have to run
`npm run make` once to create the JavaScript output file.
